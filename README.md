A brick that creates a smart web entrypoint for Flutter and preloads any type of asset before starting an app.

## Flutter Web Preloader

This brick will override the default `web/index.html` that is created with a web Flutter project.

The `index.html` file generated by this brick will add additional JavaScript code
in order to preload assets used by the Flutter app. Ensuring that when the app is
presented to the user, the assets are already cached by the browser. Doing so prevents
the application from loading piece by piece.

While the assets are being preloaded, a progress bar will be presented
to the user.

## Variables

 - `project_title`: The title of the project (defaults to the value on the `pubspec.yaml`).
 - `project_description`: The project description (defaults to the `name` attribute in the `pubspec.yaml`).
 - `batch_size`: How match assets will be loaded at the same time (defaults to `20`).
 - `canvaskit`: If the app uses `canvaskit` mode or not (defaults to `true`).

## FAQ

### Can I customize the progress bar?

Look for the `div` with the id `progress-indicator` in the generated
`web/index.html`, its style can be changed so it can have the desired look.

### What would be the optimal `batch_size`?

The `batch_size` depends on the number and average size of your assets. 

The `batch_size` can be increased when the average size of the assets is small, since the requests will finish sooner.  However, keep in mind that a large `bath_size` may trigger too many requests at the same time and it may cause unexpected issues in the browser. 

On the other hand, the `batch_size` should be decreased when the size of the assets is large.

The default `batch_size` is `20`, this should be a good number for most projects. It is not too high to cause unexpected browser issues, but also not low enough to cause the loading to take too much time.

In any case, we advise on testing when changing this value to make sure that it
won't break your app.
