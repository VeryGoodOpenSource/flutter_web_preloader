A brick that creates a smart web entrypoint for Flutter and preloads any type of asset before starting an app.

## Flutter Web Preloader

This brick will override the default `web/index.html` that is created with a web Flutter project.

The `index.html` file generated by this brick will add additional JavaScript code
in order to preload assets used by the Flutter app. Ensuring that when the app is
presented to the user, the assets are already cached by the browser. Doing so prevents
the application from loading piece by piece.

While the assets are being preloaded, a progress bar will be presented
to the user.

## Variables

 - `project_title`: The title of the project (defaults to the value on the `pubspec.yaml`).
 - `project_description`: The project description (defaults to the `name` attribute in the `pubspec.yaml`).
 - `batch_size`: How match assets will be loaded at the same time (defaults to `20`).
 - `canvaskit`: If the app uses `canvaskit` mode or not (defaults to `true`).

## FAQ

### How can I customize the progress bar?

Look for the `div` with the id `progress-indicator` in the generated
`web/index.html`, its style can be changed so it can have the desired look.

### Ho can I define the batch size for my project?

That really depends on the number and the average size of your assets. Keep in
mind that triggering too many requests at the same time may cause unexpected
issues in the browser. On the other hand if the average size of the assets are low,
that mean that the requests will finish sooner which means that this number can be
increased.

The default `20` should be a good number for most projects, which is not too high
to cause issues, but also not low that will cause the loading to take too much.

In any case, we advise on testing when changing this value to make sure that it
won't break your app.
